"""
In data science, there exists the concept of stemming, which is the heuristic of chopping off the end of a word to clean and bucket it into an easier feature set.Â 

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence, 
write a function replace_words to stem all the words in the sentence with the root forming it. 
If a word has many roots that can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.
